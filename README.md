# backdoor-detection
This is a project that was written to block the backdoor urls that are currently being used.

# Installation
* Enter your server files.
* After entering the "citizen\scripting\lua" folders, there should be a lua file called "scheduler.lua".
* After finding the function named "PerformHttpRequest" in it, we replace it with the "PerformHttpRequest" function I gave and you are ready.

If you like the project, I would be very happy if you write +rep to the topic I opened on cfx.re. Or basically u can give star if you want.
